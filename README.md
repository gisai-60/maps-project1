A place to learn about digital mapping.

*Digital mapping* is the process of creating interactive maps using computer technology to analyze and visualize geographic data.

## Key aspects of digital mapping
   - Data collection: Information is gathered using tools such as GPS, satellite imagery, and remote sensing.
   - Data storage: This geographic data is stored in digital formats, often in databases or on cloud platforms. 
   - Geographic Information Systems (GIS): GIS technology is the specialized system used to capture, store, process, and visualize this spatial data to create digital maps. 
   - Dynamic and interactive: Unlike static paper maps, digital maps are dynamic, allowing users to interact with them, zoom in, and get up-to-date information. 
   - Data analysis: [Digital maps](https://maptelligent.com/blog/what-is-digital-mapping/) are powerful tools for analyzing data. For example, they can be used to visualize demographic changes, analyze environmental data, or identify patterns that aren't obvious in a spreadsheet.

This is a sample digital map:
