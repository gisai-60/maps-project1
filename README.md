# Digital Scholarship Foundations Mapping Template

Participants in Digital Scholarship Foundations Fall 2025 (and any adventurous digital scholarship practitioners who come across this repo) will fork this repository to advance through the workshop series.

This is part 4 of a 4-part workshop series, in which participants will create their own leaflet map and use GitHub pages to publish that map.

## About Digital Scholarship Foundations: Digital Mapping

Digital Scholarship Foundations is a series of library workshops led by Digital Scholarship Services (DiScho).

Our fall program is centered around digital mapping to develop fundamental skills necessary for a variety of digital projects. Participants will attend four workshops where they will learn about version control, data wrangling, coding templates, web publishing, and more as they transform research into spatial data and build their own interactive map.
